## DND 5e Character Roller

Currently, this is in development.

Pulls from [this API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/).

End goal is to have a front-end which allows a user to:
- Sign in, up, out, change password.
- Save, load, edit, and delete characters saved in a separate API.
- See a visualization of their character based on chosen class/race/subclass.
- Export character data which is loaded into a 5e character sheet form, for use in actual play.
